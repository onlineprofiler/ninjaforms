NinjaForms Lite is the free version of NinjaForms Pro. Its drag and drop interface makes it easy to create both simple and complex forms.

== Description ==
NinjaForms Lite is a fully-functional WordPress form creation plugin, with an interface designed to look right at home within your WordPress dashboard.

NinjaForms is a WordPress form building plugin for the rest of us. While there are plenty of other form building plugins available, they tend to be either very expensive or overly complicated. 
Our guess is you just want something that works without having to take out a second mortgage or fumble through complicated wizards. And you definitely don’t want to have to mess with the code. NinjaForms is the perfect solution.

End users aren’t the only ones who can benefit from NinjaForms simplicity either. Developers can also extend their projects with Ninjas Forms by using it’s convenient hooks and simple structure. 
And because Ninjas Forms is licensed under the GPL you can use it on all of your projects without any restrictions…forever. Stop wrestling with web forms that are overly complicated and confusing. 
With NinjaForms, the WordPress Form builder plugin,  you can easily create almost any type of WordPress form you might need and customize it as much or as little as you like.

Some of the features of NinjaForms Lite:

	* Create any type of restricted input field by using our easy to use filters.
	* Add a spam filter to prevent those pesky bots from filling out your form.
	* Save form submissions and download them in .xsl format.
	* Show custom help text for any form field.
	* Send a completion message to the end-user and to a list of email addresses. You can even customze the email address this comes from.
	* Use required fields to ensure that your users fill in important information.
	* Easily create dropdowns, multi-selects, checkboxs, radio buttons, etc. with our drag and drop interface.
	* Attach a form to a page or post by simply checking a box, or use our shortcodes and functions to place your form anywhere you want.
	* Fully customizable CSS, make your form look the way you want.
	
	
Upgrade to NinjaForms Pro and get these additional features:

	* Allow users to create posts/pages/etc. from a front-end form.
	* Make long forms easier to manage by separating them into sections using multi-part forms.
	* Give users the option to save their progress and come back to complete the form at a later date.
	* Access to powerful pre and post processing hooks so you can manipulate the form data however you want.
